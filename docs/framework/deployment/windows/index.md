# Installing the .NET Framework on Windows

The following documents describe how to install the .NET Framework for each Windows version.

## Version Differences

The .NET Framework is included with Windows. Each Windows version includes a single .NET Framework version, which may not be the one you need. If you would like to use a different version of the .NET Framework for a given version of Windows, then you must install it.

In general, a higher .NET Framework version will run an application that was built for a lower .NET Framework version. For example, the .NET Framework 4.6.2 will run an application built for .NET Framework 4.0. There is one exception to this rule. Applications built for .NET Framework 1.0 through 3.5 can be run on .NET Framework 3.5 but not on .NET Framework 4.0 or later.
