# .NET Framework Guide

The .NET Framework is a development platform for building applications for Windows, Windows Server, and Microsoft Azure. It consists of the common language runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework class library, which includes a broad range of functionality and support for many industry standards. 

The .NET Framework provides many services, including memory management, type and memory safety, security functionality, networking and application deployment. It provides easy-to-use data structures and APIs that abstract the lower-level Windows operating system. You can use a variety of programming languages with the .NET Framework, including C#, F# and Visual Basic.

## Deployment

The .NET Framework comes with Windows, enabling you to run .NET Framework applications. You may need a later version of the .NET Framework than comes with your Windows version. See [Deploying the .NET Framework on Windows](./deployment/windows/index.md) to learn how to deploy the .NET Framework on Windows.

See [Repair the .NET Framework](./deployment/repair.md) to learn how to repair your .NET Framework installation if you are experiencing errors when installing the .NET Framework.

The .NET Framework can be used with Docker, with [Windows Containers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/about_overview). See [Deploying .NET Framework applications with Docker](./docker/index.md) to learn how to run your applications in Docker containers.
