# Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac

This article shows you the supported macOS versions and .NET Core dependencies that you need to develop, deploy, and run .NET Core applications on macOS machines. The supported OS versions and depdendencies that follow apply to the three ways of developing .NET Core apps on a Mac: via the [command-line with your favorite editor](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md), [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/).

## Supported macOS versions

.NET Core is supported by the following versions of macOS:

* macOS 10.12 "Sierra"
* macOS 10.11 "El Capitan"

See the [.NET Core Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.1/1.1.md) for the complete list of supported operating systems.

## .NET Core dependencies

.NET Core requires OpenSSL when running on macOS. An easy way to obtain OpenSSL is by using the [Homebrew ("brew")](http://brew.sh/) package manager for macOS. After installing *brew*, install OpenSSL by executing the following commands at a Terminal (command) prompt:

```Terminal
brew update
brew install openssl
mkdir -p /usr/local/lib
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/
```

After installing OpenSSL, obtain the official [.NET Core SDK for Mac installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843444). .NET Core 1.1.1 is the latest version. For long-term support versions and additional downloads, visit [.NET Downloads: All downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). If you have problems with the installation on macOS, consult [Known issues & workarounds](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/cli/known-issues.md).

## Visual Studio for Mac

.NET Core development on macOS with Visual Studio for Mac requires:

* A supported version of the macOS operating system
* OpenSSL
* .NET Core SDK for Mac
* [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)
